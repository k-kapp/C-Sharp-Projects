#Sokoban

A Sokoban clone. The user must push all boxes onto the dots. This version that I wrote can take customized maps (puzzles) to play on. At the moment text files are used as input for the puzzle (see test1.txt for a sample), but I plan to write a small add-on that will essentially be a puzzle editor in a GUI.
