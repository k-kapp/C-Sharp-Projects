#Sokoban

A Sokoban clone. The user must push all boxes onto the dots. This version that I wrote can take customized maps (puzzles) to play on. 

A custom API was written to facilitate the creation of a GUI for the game. This included creating classes for buttons, forms, etc. This was done using the graphics functionality given by the XNA framework (through Monogame).
