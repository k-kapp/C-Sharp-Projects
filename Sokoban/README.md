#Sokoban

This directory has exactly the same content as the Sokoban repository on my profile. I will remove this when I get the chance (the web client for github does not allow folders to be removed easily, so will have to remove the whole repo and re add it, or download some github client for windows (more likely) ).

Please refer to the Sokoban repository, instead of this folder.
